# Lab 1 - Getting Started with Kubernetes

## Directory Setup

1. Make sure that you are well aware of the directory you will be using for your labs.

2. If you're on codespaces, note that `~/workspace` is the default directory that will open everytime you launch vs code.

3. Set your current working directory to `cw_labs\kubernetes`. We will be storing our `k8s` related labs inside this directory.
