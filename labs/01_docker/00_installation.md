# Installation

> **Note:** If you are on vs online, docker is already made available in your environment.

Just type `docker` in the terminal to see if docker is running.

For installing a community version on your own machine, see:

* [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* [Install Docker Desktop for Mac
](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [All other users see here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

> You will need a terminal / CLI to work with Docker. (VS online users, just use built-in terminal on vs code)
