# Installation

> **Note: If you are on vs online, docker is already made available in your environment.**

Just type `docker` in the terminal to see if docker is running.

**If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, you wouldn't be able to do Docker labs** (kubernetes labs should work fine)

If you're interested in installing a community version on your own machine, see:

* [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* [Install Docker Desktop for Mac
](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [All other users see here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

> You will need a terminal / CLI to work with Docker. (VS online users, just use built-in terminal on vs code)
